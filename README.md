## AppSwitcherPrivacyScreenObjC

A sample app which demonstrates how to hide sensitive information in an iOS app's snapshot image in the App Switcher. This version is for Objective-C. There is also a [Swift Version](https://github.com/hacknicity/AppSwitcherPrivacyScreen).  

See my Medium article [Hide Sensitive Information in the iOS App Switcher Snapshot Image](https://medium.com/@hacknicity/hide-sensitive-information-in-the-ios-app-switcher-snapshot-image-25ddc9b8ef5f) for details on how the technique works.

A `pre-ios-13-support` branch has extra code which and extends the solution to work prior to iOS 13 where the App Delegate is responsible for showing the privacy protection window.
